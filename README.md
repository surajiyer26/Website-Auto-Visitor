# Website-Auto-Visitor

Ever felt the need to have an increased number of visits to your portfolio website? Increased number of views on your Instagram reel? Or maybe an increased number of impressions on the unstop page of a event you might be hosting in your college? Well, this this the right place to be.

With a rather simple mechanism, a Python script having a mere 15 lines of code, you can complete the above tasks and fulfill any other needs that you may have of this kind.

Firstly, you need to <b>pip install keyboard</b> in you device -

</br>

Now all you have to do is open the visitor.py file in your favorite code editor -

This is it, the code that is going to work this magic. All you have to do now is follow these 3 steps -

(1) Plug in the number of times you want to visit a website in the 'count' variable.

</br>

(2) Then you plug in the number of seconds you want the tabs to close after in the 'secs' variable (you will understand more about this once you actually run the code).

</br>

(3) Finally you write down the url of the website of your choice as a string in the 'url' variable.

</br>

Once you're done with these 3 steps, the code will look something like this -

And there you go! You can run the code via command prompt or simply double tap the icon of visitor.py to watch the magic unfold!
